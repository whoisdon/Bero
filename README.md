## Settings
Within the `.env` file, we will store a few variables:

```plaintext
TOKEN=
```
To set up your application, follow these steps: Locate the `.env.example` file in your project repository. Rename the file from `.env.example` to `.env`. In the `.env` file, you'll find a line similar to this:

```plaintext
TOKEN=
```
After the equal sign (=), paste your Discord bot token. It should look like this:
```plaintext
TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
```
Save the `.env` file.

Now, your application is configured to use the Discord bot token you've provided in the `.env` file. Remember to keep this file secure and never share your token with anyone else.
